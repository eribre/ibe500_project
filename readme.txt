Hi, thanks for having a look at my bsv based project


To start the server, run "node index.js" with this folder as the working directory.

Then go to a browser of your choice (this has only been tested in firefox though),
and enter http://localhost:3000

You should now be on the main page, click the first link (new transaction) to go to the
tool for creating new transactions.

The tool for viewing transactions has yet to be implemented.
